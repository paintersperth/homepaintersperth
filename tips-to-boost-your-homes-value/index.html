<p>If you’re thinking about selling your home in the next year or two, you’ll naturally be hoping to get as much money for it as possible. That means you may need to come up with some creative ways to spruce up your living space and make it attractive to buyers – after all, it’s a very competitive market, with so many people looking for their ‘dream home’. You need to turn your home into the kind of place where other people can see themselves spending their future.</p>

<h2 id="add-value-to-your-property-before-you-sell">Add Value To Your Property Before You Sell</h2>

<p>There are a multitude of ways you can add some value to a property before you sell it – whether that means calling in a Perth painter and decorator, or going the whole hog and extending your property. Here are some of our top tips to boost your home’s value before you put it on the market.</p>

<h3 id="step-one-the-outside-of-the-property">STEP ONE: THE OUTSIDE OF THE PROPERTY</h3>

<p>The property’s exterior and the garden space is the first thing a potential buyer will see of your home – and we all know that first impressions count. If your property looks a little run-down or shabby from the outside, it’s important to address this issue. If you have a brick home with missing gaps, fill them in, or render over them to create a clean and fresh look. If your home has been painted, give it another coat to freshen it up and make it look brand new. You should also pay attention to things like your driveway and paving, as well as the front garden. Plant some simple flowers to brighten it up, and make sure the lawn is mown before each viewing!</p>

<h3 id="step-two-interior-basics">STEP TWO: INTERIOR BASICS</h3>

<p>Inside the home, you should be looking to give all door frames, window frames, skirting boards and banisters a new coat of paint. This gives the entire place a ‘finished’ look, and if you’re using the same colour for all of them, it ties the home together. If you’re not sure whether you can do the job, call in a <a href="https://homepaintersperth.com.au/house-painting-perth/">Perth home painter </a>and decorator to get the job done to a very high standard.</p>

<h3 id="step-three-walls-and-floors">STEP THREE: WALLS AND FLOORS</h3>

<p>You should also seek to freshen up the walls and flooring before you put a property on the market. Many estate agents will suggest restoring your interiors to a neutral shade before you try to sell – it acts as more of a ‘blank canvas’ for potential buyers. If you’ve used bright, vibrant colours or avant-garde shades in any of your rooms, it may be time to paint over them with a few coats of paint in a neutral tone, that won’t be likely to put anyone off. Of course, you still need some personality in the home, so a few splashes of colour here and there are fine, but try to look at the property with an objective eye and imagine you’re viewing it as a buyer.</p>

<p>If you have carpets, they should be professionally deep cleaned, and if you have laminate flooring, lino or stone floors, you should make sure they’re sparkling and fresh before each viewing.</p>

<h3 id="step-four-fitting-and-fixture-upgrades">STEP FOUR: FITTING AND FIXTURE UPGRADES</h3>

<p>This tip mostly applies to your bathroom and kitchen. These are the two rooms which can typically add the most value to a property, so you may as well take advantage of this fact. Consider upgrading your taps to something more sleek and stylish, and consider things like new tiling or countertops to give the place a bit of a revamp. If you have the renovation funds available, you could turn your bathroom into a wet room, or even extend your kitchen to make it a more communal space – open-plan kitchen-diners are very on trend right now. If you’re on a tighter budget, carry out smaller jobs like replacing tile grout, or <a href="https://homepaintersperth.com.au/kitchen-cabinets-painting-staining-refinishing-refacing-perth/">painting kitchen cupboard</a> doors a different colour.</p>

<h3 id="step-five-cleaning-and-organizing">STEP FIVE: CLEANING AND ORGANIZING</h3>

<p>As we’ve mentioned, your home needs to be as blank a canvas as possible when showing it to potential buyers. That doesn’t mean you should pack away all of your belongings – in fact, you should leave some personal items around to show the buyer that this is a happy family home and help them see themselves living there. But clutter of all types needs to be tidied away – and be careful where you put it! If you have large wardrobes, cupboards and other storage spaces in the home, it’s likely that buyers will want to have a look in them to gauge their size. The last thing you want is for them to open a cupboard and see a mountain of junk stashed away in there! Consider hiring a self-storage space for most of your belongings, at least until you can move them into a new property.</p>

<h3 id="step-six-finishing-touches">STEP SIX: FINISHING TOUCHES</h3>

<p>Lastly, there are a few extra finishing touches you can carry out to make your home more inviting and welcoming to potential buyers. Upgrade or clean your light switches and fixtures – perhaps consider installing dimmers or spotlights, if you have the funds available. Lighting is important when selling a home, and when positioned correctly, they can give the illusion of space.</p>

<p>Carry out additional DIY tasks that you might have been putting off. Oil the squeaky kitchen door, fix the handle that you’ve been meaning to get round to, mend shelves that won’t be coming with you, and give the entire place a good dusting.</p>
